# Grid for Blazor - Conditional Formatting

The [Blazor Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid) allows you to customize the appearance of UI elements based on custom conditions.  

This example customizes grid cells and rows in the following ways: 
 
* Data cells with `UnitsInStock < 10` are highlighted. 
* Data rows with `UnitsInStock = 0` are strikethrough. 
* `UnitPrice` values are bold and colored depending on the following condition:  
  * If a price is lower than the average price, the font is red. 
  * If a price is higher than the average price, the font is green. 
	
    The average price is calculated in the grid's summary item ([DxGridSummaryItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem)).
