# Grid for Blazor - Customize the appearance of elements including row and cell values based on custom conditions

The [Blazor Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid) allows you to customize the appearance of individual UI elements based on custom conditions (conditional formatting).

This example customizes the appearance of Blazor Grid cells/rows in the following manner:
 
* Highlighted data cells: `UnitsInStock < 10`. 
* Strikethrough data rows: `UnitsInStock = 0`. 
* `UnitPrice` values are set to bold and colored based on the following conditions:  
  * If a price is lower than the average price, the font is set to red. 
  * If a price is higher than the average price, the font is set to green. 
	
    The average price is calculated within the Blazor Grid's summary item ([DxGridSummaryItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem)).
