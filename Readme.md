# Grid for Blazor - Conditional Formatting

The Blazor Grid allows you to customize appearance of UI elements based on custom conditions. 

This example customizes grid cells and rows in the following way.

* Data cells with UnitsInStock < 10 are highlighted.
* Data rows with UnitsInStock = 0 are strikethrough.
* UnitPrice values are bold and colored depending on the following condition: 
		* if a price is lower then the average price, the font is red;  
		* if a price is higher then the average price, the font is green.
	The average price is calculated in the grid's summary item (DxGridSummaryItem).
