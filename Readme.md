# Grid for Blazor - Customize cell appearance based on custom conditions

The example demonstrates how to customize appearance of [DevExpress Blazor Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid) elements based on custom conditions.


![Grid - Customize Element Appearance](images/grid.png)

The code example uses [summary items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridSummaryItem) to calculate minimum, maximum, and average column values. Based on cell and summary item values, a [CustomizeElement](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.CustomizeElement) event handler changes cell appearance in the following columns:

**Discount Column**  
Cells that display positive values are colored green.

**Unit Price Column**  
All cell values are bold. If a cell value is lower than the column average value, the cell's font color is green; otherwise, it is red.


**Quantity Column**  
If a cell value is lower than the average column value, the cell is colored in a shade of red; otherwise, it is a shade of blue. The more a cell value differs from the average value, the brighter the color. If a cell value is equal to the average value, the color is white.


**Total Column**  
A cell displays one of the following arrows based on its value:
* A red arrow pointing down - small values.

* A yellow arrow pointing left - medium values.

* A green arrow pointing up - large values.
